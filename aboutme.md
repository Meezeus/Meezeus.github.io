👋 Hello there! My name is **Kacper Dudzinski** and I'm a **programmer** who's
passionate about **game dev** and in particular **video game AI**. I'm a quick
learner, an organised worker and a resilient individual. I pride myself on the
quality of my work and am always eager to learn more and become better.

🎓 I attended **King's College London**, where I studied **MSci (Hons) Computer
Science**, specialising in **Artificial Intelligence**. I graduated with
**First-Class Honours**, with an overall score of 88 (out of 100).

🏆 During my time at KCL, I was awarded the **Springer Nature Prize** (best
performance by a third year MSci student in the Department of Informatics) and
the **British Computing Society Prize** (best performance in any year of the
BSc/MSci Computer Science) in the 2021-22 academic session.

❤ Aside from programming and video games, some of my other interests include
Karate (which I have been practising for over 17 years, both as a student and as
an instructor), board games/TTRPGs, legends/folklore/mythology, reading and hiking.
